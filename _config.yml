  #### About me
  <br>
  Data is fun. I love playing with data. I transitioned into Analytics and Data Science from a Business Intelligence background. 
  Naturally, visual story telling and creating actionable insights from raw data were my interest. As I learned Machine Learning and advanced analytics, 
  I felt the need for a git existence for all my side projects. This page serves the purpose.
