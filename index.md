## [Hotel Recommendation](https://anirbanpaldsc.github.io/Hotel-Recommendation/)

<img align="left" src="images/hotel.png" data-canonical-src="images/hotel.png" width="150" height="300" />All online travel agencies are scrambling to meet the Artificial Intelligence driven personalization standard set by Amazon and Netflix. In addition, the world of online travel has become a highly competitive space where brands try to capture our attention (and wallet) with recommending, comparing, matching, and sharing. For this assignment, we aim to create the optimal hotel recommendations for Expedia’s users that are searching for a hotel to book. For this assignment, you need to predict which “hotel cluster” the user is likely to book, given his (or her) search details.
